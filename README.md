# Puzzle-Game
java game to use keyboard and mouse to play
Implemented Java UI design and Java structure by testing multiple times every function such as login, moving puzzles, creating puzzles, changing pictures, and showing original pictures.
Designed puzzle game login and game playing UI with some fancy pictures to increase the game’s attractiveness and found the most suitable position for every label shown on the screen to satisfy user convenience requirements; make the game more user-friendly by adjusting every element and function of the program; learned to sort Java classes by different usage, thus, building the program more conveniently for developers to modify the program.
Effectively led 2 group members to design a ‘puzzle move’ function, considering every possible situation that might cause the program to collapse.
